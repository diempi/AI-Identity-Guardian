# AI Identity Guardian

**AI Identity Guardian** is an onchain dApp for secure, decentralized identity.  
It allows users to prove their identity or status (KYC, DAO access, Web3 login) **without ever exposing sensitive data directly**.

## 🚀 Goal
To create a privacy-preserving identity verification solution using the **0G stack**, making KYC and authentication more secure, transparent, and universal.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Encrypted storage of sensitive data with **0G Storage**
- Cryptographic checks and AI-based proofs via **0G Compute**
- Access management and status verification with **0G Chain** (smart contracts)
- Real-world use cases:  
  - DAO membership validation  
  - Decentralized KYC for DeFi  
  - Universal Web3 authentication  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 0G Chain (EVM-compatible)
- 0G Compute (AI + proofs)
- 0G Storage (sensitive data)
- Solidity / Hardhat for smart contracts
- React or Next.js for frontend

## 📅 Roadmap (Waves)
- **Wave 1 (Ideation)**: Concept definition, repo setup, project pitch  
- **Wave 2 (Prototype)**: Smart contract for identity status + basic frontend  
- **Wave 3 (Working Demo)**: Integration of Storage + Compute, demo of decentralized login  
- **Final Wave**: Improved version with a concrete KYC or DAO use case
